Prompt for Replit Agent to Build Inventory Module

Objective:
Create an Inventory Module to manage 52 stands, where both Raw Materials (blocks) and Finished Goods (processed slabs) are stored. The system should auto-calculate the number of blocks and finished goods in inventory based on real-time updates.

Functional Requirements:
	1.	Stand Management:
	â€¢	There are 52 stands in total.
	â€¢	Each stand can hold either raw materials (blocks) or finished goods (slabs).
	â€¢	The system must track which stand is occupied and with what type of material.
	2.	Raw Material Inventory:
	â€¢	When raw materials (blocks) are received, they are assigned to an available stand.
	â€¢	The system should auto-update the number of raw material blocks currently in inventory.
	â€¢	If a block is moved to Cutting, it should be removed from raw material inventory.
	3.	Production Tracking & Inventory Update:
	â€¢	When a block completes Polishing, it becomes a Finished Good.
	â€¢	Finished goods should be automatically added to inventory and assigned an available stand.
	â€¢	If no stand is available, alert the user that storage is full.
	4.	Auto-Calculation of Inventory:
	â€¢	Total Blocks in Inventory = Blocks that are received but not yet moved to Cutting.
	â€¢	Total Finished Goods in Inventory = Blocks that have completed Polishing and are now stored as slabs.
	â€¢	Available Stands = Total stands (52) - (Occupied stands for raw materials + finished goods).
	â€¢	The system should auto-allocate available stands and prevent over-assigning.
	5.	Stand Reallocation:
	â€¢	If a block moves to the next processing step, its stand should be marked as available for new inventory.
	â€¢	If finished goods are dispatched or sold, their stands should also be freed.
	6.	User Interface & Features:
	â€¢	A dashboard showing:
	â€¢	Total raw materials in inventory
	â€¢	Total finished goods in inventory
	â€¢	Available stands
	â€¢	Occupied stands with details (Block Number / Finished Goods Count)
	â€¢	A function to manually override inventory if needed.

Expected Behavior in Replit:
	1.	When new raw materials arrive â†’ System assigns stands and updates inventory.
	2.	When a block moves to cutting â†’ It is removed from raw material inventory.
	3.	When a block completes polishing â†’ It is added as a finished good and assigned a stand.
	4.	If all stands are occupied â†’ The system prevents new allocations and alerts the user.

Replit Agent Instructions:
	1.	Design a database structure with fields:
	â€¢	Stand ID, Type (Raw/F.Good), Block No, Status (Occupied/Available).
	2.	Create functions for:
	â€¢	Auto-allocating stands when new items arrive.
	â€¢	Removing blocks from inventory when they enter production.
	â€¢	Updating inventory count and available stands dynamically.
	3.	Build a simple UI/dashboard to display real-time inventory data.

End Goal: A fully automated inventory system where stand allocation and stock tracking happen dynamically with minimal manual intervention. ðŸš€

This prompt ensures that the agent follows through on building the complete module instead of getting sidetracked. Let me know if you want any refinements!
