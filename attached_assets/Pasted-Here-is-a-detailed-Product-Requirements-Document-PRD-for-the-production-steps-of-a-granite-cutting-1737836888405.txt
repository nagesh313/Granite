Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Granite Cutting and Processing Application

Version: 1.0
Owner: [Your Name/Team]
Date: [Insert Date]

Objective

Develop a digital platform to streamline and automate the production processes at a granite cutting and processing unit. This includes managing raw materials, cutting, grinding, polishing, and inventory operations with real-time data capture and reporting.

Scope

The platform will focus on the following production steps:
	1.	Raw Material Management
	2.	Cutting (Production Start)
	3.	Grinding
	4.	Chemical and Epoxy Processes (Conditional)
	5.	Polishing
	6.	Finished Goods Management

Functional Requirements

1. Raw Material Management
	•	Order Placement: Allow users to input details of raw materials ordered, including supplier and estimated delivery date.
	•	Inventory Check-In:
	•	Capture the following details for each raw material block:
	•	Unique Block Number
	•	Dimensions (Length, Width, Height)
	•	Net Weight and Individual Block Weight (auto-calculated using dimensions and density)
	•	Size, Color Quality, and Marka (company ownership)
	•	Mine’s Name and Vehicle Number
	•	Type of Block (Single, Double, or Triple with suffix A/B/C)
	•	Photos (both sides) and Comments
	•	Automated Inventory Updates:
	•	System updates stock when blocks are checked into the storage area (Gantry).

2. Cutting (Production Start)
	•	Loading:
	•	Track Block Number, Machine Number, and Trolley Number (total 2 trolleys).
	•	Blade and Segment Management:
	•	Blade Life (Approx 2L sqft per blade).
	•	Segment Life (Approx 30k sqft per segment).
	•	Brazing records (segments added to blades).
	•	Cutting Process Tracking:
	•	Record start and end time, machine logs (Job Card).
	•	Machine stop logs, including reasons:
	•	Power outage
	•	Maintenance
	•	Segment Height (mm) and measurement of all 14 blade segments.
	•	Output Capture:
	•	Total slabs produced after cutting.
	•	Post-cutting photos of slabs.
	•	System Automation:
	•	Auto-generate machine logs and job cards for each process.

3. Grinding
	•	Line Polishing Machine Tracking (Night Shift):
	•	Block vs. Pieces Mapping.
	•	Record start and end time, including reasons for machine stoppages:
	•	No Light
	•	Maintenance
	•	Output Calculation:
	•	Total pieces processed in 12 hours (approx. 300 slabs).
	•	Record defects and irregularities.
	•	Abrasive Life Management:
	•	Track and manage abrasive life (TBD values).
	•	Output Capture:
	•	Photos of regular and defective slabs.

4. Chemical Converter and Epoxy Application
	•	Conditional Execution:
	•	Skipped for ‘direct polish’ material slabs.
	•	Manual Process Management:
	•	Logs of manual application (if required).

5. Polishing
	•	Line Polish Machine Tracking (Day Shift):
	•	Block vs. Pieces Mapping.
	•	Record start and end time, including stoppage reasons:
	•	No Light
	•	Maintenance
	•	Output Calculation:
	•	Total pieces processed in 12 hours (approx. 300 slabs).
	•	Record defects and irregularities.
	•	Abrasive Life Management:
	•	Track and manage abrasive life (TBD values).
	•	Output Capture:
	•	Photos of regular and defective slabs.

6. Finished Goods Management
	•	Inventory Update:
	•	Move finished slabs into inventory.
	•	Stock shade management (52 stands available).
	•	Output Capture:
	•	Photos of finished slabs for documentation.

Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Usability:
	•	Intuitive user interface for manual and automated data entry.
	•	Scalability:
	•	Support for expanding inventory, production, and storage needs.
	•	Data Security:
	•	Secure storage of production data and photos.
	•	System Integration:
	•	Ability to integrate with existing ERP or inventory management systems.
	•	Reporting and Analytics:
	•	Generate reports for production efficiency, downtime, and inventory usage.

Success Metrics
	•	Reduction in manual errors during production tracking.
	•	Enhanced visibility into inventory and production status.
	•	Real-time tracking of blade, segment, and abrasive life.
	•	Improved reporting accuracy for downtime and machine performance.

Deliverables
	•	Fully functional web or mobile application.
	•	Dashboard for production and inventory insights.
	•	Automated job card generation for all production stages.
	•	Integration with photo capture systems.

Feel free to customize or add additional features based on specific requirements.
