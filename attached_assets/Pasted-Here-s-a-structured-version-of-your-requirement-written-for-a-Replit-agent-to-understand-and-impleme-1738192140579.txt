Here’s a structured version of your requirement written for a Replit agent to understand and implement:

Step-by-Step Block Processing Workflow

1. Process Flow Control
	•	A block must follow a sequential process:
Cutting → Grinding → (Chemical Converter - Optional) → (Epoxy - Optional) → Polishing
	•	Polishing is the final step; only after polishing is completed, the block is considered a finished product.
	•	Chemical Converter and Epoxy can be skipped based on material type, but all other steps are mandatory.

2. Block Visibility Logic for Job Creation
	•	When creating a new job in any step, only blocks that have completed the previous step should be visible in the dropdown.
	•	Example:
	•	In Grinding Module: Only blocks that have completed Cutting should appear in the Block Number dropdown.
	•	In Chemical Converter Module: Only blocks that have completed Grinding should appear in the Block Number dropdown.
	•	In Epoxy Module: Only blocks that have completed Grinding (or Chemical Converter, if not skipped) should appear.
	•	In Polishing Module: Only blocks that have completed Grinding (or Epoxy, if applicable) should appear.

3. Skippable Steps Logic
	•	If Chemical Converter is skipped: The block moves directly from Grinding → Epoxy (if applicable) → Polishing.
	•	If Epoxy is skipped: The block moves directly from Grinding (or Chemical Converter) → Polishing.
	•	Skipping is only allowed for Chemical Converter and Epoxy; all other steps must be completed in order.

4. Status Tracking & Completion Rules
	•	Each block should have a status field to track its progress:
	•	Pending → Block is awaiting the current process step.
	•	In Progress → Block is currently undergoing a step.
	•	Completed → Block has successfully completed a step and is eligible for the next process.
	•	The system should only allow job creation for a block in the next step if the previous step is marked as “Completed”.
	•	Blocks should not be available in a module’s dropdown until their previous step is marked “Completed”.

5. Agent Implementation Guidelines
	•	Maintain a centralized block status database to track each block’s progress.
	•	Filter the block dropdown dynamically based on each block’s status:
	•	Query the database to show only blocks that have Completed status in the required previous step.
	•	Validate job creation requests to prevent skipping required steps.
	•	Allow skipping of Chemical Converter and Epoxy, but ensure Polishing is the final required step.
	•	Once Polishing is complete, update the block’s status as “Finished Product”, making it unavailable for further processing.

Expected Behavior in Replit Agent
	1.	When a user creates a Cutting job → All raw blocks should be available.
	2.	When a user creates a Grinding job → Only blocks that have Completed Cutting should be available.
	3.	When a user creates a Chemical Converter or Epoxy job:
	•	If a block’s material requires Chemical Converter, it must be completed before appearing in Epoxy.
	•	If a block’s material skips Chemical Converter, it should go directly to Epoxy (if applicable) or Polishing.
	4.	When a user creates a Polishing job → Only blocks that have Completed Grinding or the optional steps should be available.
	5.	After Polishing is marked “Completed”, update the block’s status as “Finished Product”, and remove it from all processing dropdowns.

This structured logic will ensure that blocks progress step by step without skipping mandatory steps, while also allowing flexibility for optional processes. Let me know if you need refinements! 🚀
